# contacts
It is a simple console application without graphics. It is similar to the contact manager in cell phones. In this project, you can add, view, edit, sort and delete contacts. All added and edited records are saved in a file.

You can list contacts by name, phone no., address and email. File handling has been used to record all data. I have used data structure to store the user name, email and contact. Overall, understanding the simple source code of this project will teach you how to add, edit, search, list and remove data of file.

The source code for contact management system project in C is complete and totally error-free. It is short and simple â€“ just over 201 lines. It is compiled in VS Code IDE with GCC compiler.
